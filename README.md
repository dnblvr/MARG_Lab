# ECE 425 - MARG Lab
In this project, Jacob Bonilla and I have jointly created HAL to interact with two sensors: the accel/gyro and the magnetometer (combined to form a MARG sensor) over I2C. In future, this firmware can be used to develop an orientation state-estimator algorithm. 

The sensors used are the following: 
* MPU6050
* QMC5883L
